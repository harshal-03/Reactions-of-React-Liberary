Props are like parameters to a function

e.g.:- 
i> wihtout props:- 
    function MyHeader(){
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>
    }
this is not a good practice as it will always render the <h1> tag only

ii> with props:- 
    function MyHeader(){
        return <h1>{props.title}</h1>
    }

    <MyHeader title="This is my heading" />

"We render the <h1> tag content inside the curly bracket {} as it is dynamic value"

Props basically makes our compponents more generic
